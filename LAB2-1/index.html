            <p> This is the start of a really short paragraph. It has some other nested tags to emphasise/highlight some
                of the text. For example:
                <strong> This is bold text.</strong>
                And, even more exciting:
                <i> This is italic text!</i>
            </p>

        <article>
            <p>
                This is a paragraph explaining the image below.
                Remember: images use a self-closing tag, and the image URL is set by the "src" attribute.

            <h3> This is a subheadline wrapped in "h3" tags</h3>

                If we have a URL like the one at the end of this paragraph then it should be hyperlinked using the
                correct tag:
                <a href="https://www.google.com"> https://google.com</a>
            </p>

                Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the
                industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type and
                scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap
                into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with the
                release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more recently with desktop publishing
                software like Aldus PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.
