    <h2> ¿Why do we use lorem Ipsum?</h2>
    <p> <b> It is a long established fact that a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when
            looking at its layout.</b>
        <mark> The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a more-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed
            to using 'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English. </mark>
        <strong> Many desktop publishing packages and web page editors now use Lorem Ipsum as their default model text,
            and a search for 'lorem ipsum' will uncover many web sites still in their infancy.</strong>
        <i>Various versions have evolved over the years, sometimes by accident, </i>
        <em> sometimes on purpose (injected humour and the like).</em>
